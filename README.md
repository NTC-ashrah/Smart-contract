Display connected account address and balance
Deposit ETH to the smart contract
Withdraw ETH from the smart contract
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
MetaMask browser extension
An Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli)
Installation
