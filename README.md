# Smart Contract Example with require(), assert(), and revert()

This smart contract, written in Solidity, demonstrates the usage of the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements for enforcing conditions and handling errors in Ethereum smart contracts.

## Functions Overview

### `requireExample(uint _value)`

This function checks if the input value provided by the caller is not zero. If the value is zero, it aborts the transaction, reverts any state changes, and returns an error message indicating that zero is not allowed.

### `assertExample(uint _value)`

Similar to `requireExample`, this function also ensures that the input value is not zero. However, it behaves more strictly by immediately reverting the transaction without providing an error message. It's typically used for internal consistency checks.

### `revertExample(uint _value)`

This function evaluates the input value and, if it's zero, gracefully reverts the transaction, providing an informative error message to the caller. It serves as a conditional revert mechanism, allowing for customized error handling based on specific conditions.

## Usage

1. Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler such as `solc`.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network using a tool like Remix or Truffle.
3. Interact with the deployed contract by calling its functions, passing appropriate non-zero values to observe their behavior.
4. Monitor the transaction results to understand how `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements affect the contract execution.
